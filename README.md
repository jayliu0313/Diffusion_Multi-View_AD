# Multi_Lightings
  There are six lighting images in every samples.
  Fuse_Reconstruct: In each sample, we reconstruct their mean fc of the six lightings' fc, and reconstruct them.
  Mean_Reconstruct: In each sample, we replace their fc to other lightings' fc, and reconstruct all of the possibility.
