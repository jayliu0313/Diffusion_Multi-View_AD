# Multi_Lightings
There are six lighting images in every samples.<br>
Fuse_Reconstruct: In each sample, we reconstruct their mean fc of the six lightings' fc, and reconstruct them.<br>
Mean_Reconstruct: In each sample, we replace their fc to other lightings' fc, and reconstruct all of the possibility.<br>
